# DHBW-Template

Based on the [official guidelines](https://www.heilbronn.dhbw.de/fileadmin/user_upload/dhbw/downloads/Allgemeines_Studiengangsuebergreifend/Richtlinien_wiss._Arbeiten_DHBW_HN_Version_vom_05.03.2021_gueltig_ab_Studienjahrgang_2018.pdf) for writing scientific papers, I created a word template which (hopefully) implemented every aspect of these guidelines.
